        <p>These ideas sometimes seem at odds. A <a href="./garden-games">garden suggests curation</a>, but brains
            aren't curated (at least, mine isn't!). But by building this space as <a href="./digital-garden">both a
                digital garden and a second brain</a>, I am (hopefully) reducing overhead and eliminating some of the
            difficulty of adoption. The end result treats meta-notes like these (and evergreen notes) the same way it
            treats random thoughts about worlds I'd like to build. That kind of makes sense--it's a lot more like how my
            brain works, I guess.</p>
        <p>And maybe the garden part of all this has less to do with how I curate this content and more to do with how I
            make it and share it:</p>
        <blockquote>
            digital gardening is not about specific tools â€“ it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll
            template. It's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information - one that
            accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space. <a

                    of digital gardens</em></a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's about behavior: by writing my unpolished thoughts here for my own benefit and connecting them using the
            magic of hyperlinks, I fall into a pattern that creates a space primed for wandering and exploration.</p>
