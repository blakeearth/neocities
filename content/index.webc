	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to blake.earth, web traveller! Here you'll (eventually) find a
		trove of silly personal content, gamedev chats, media logs, recipes, and
		whatever other nonsense I decide to post on here.

	<h3>About the webmaster</h3>
	<p>isaac blake ðŸ’› he/him</p>
	<p>I'm a tinkerer and a try-it-all-er. I love to design systems, goof off at
		the park, play board games and D&D, and make music with my friends.</p>
	<p>I live in a studio with big windows and a brick patio. I'm near close
		friends whom I love. I can
		walk to the grocery store, to the farmer's market, and to two lakes, and
		I can bus and bike pretty much
		everywhere else I'd need to go (though I still drive too much). I feel
		so lucky to have found a home here.</p>
	<h3>About this site</h3>
	<p>This site has existed in some form since 2017, when I bought this domain
		to use as part of my email address.
		Since then, I've used "blakeearth" as my handle pretty much everywhere
		on the internet.</p>
	<p>I picked ".earth" because it was available. I was also planning to study
		environmental science at
		university (in the end, I got a liberal arts degree with a concentration
		in computer science).</p>
	<p>I've been making websites as long as I've had access to the internet,
		though - since about 2010 or 2011,
		probably. I made lots of janky websites using a mix of the Webs website
		builder and HTML, including a <a
			href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504112845/http://poptropicawca.com/"
			target="_blank">fan site and
			cheats blog for Poptropica</a>. I remember making some trackers for
		Club Penguin (probably with <a
			href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140327071108/http://www.widgetbox.com/"
			target="_blank">Widgetbox</a>),
		but those seem to be lost to the sands of time.</p>
	<p>I used to play a bunch of those online virtual world games (Club Penguin,
		Poptropica, Webkinz, Wizard101, LEGO
		Universe, and others). They're a big source of creative inspiration to
		me.</p>
