Living in Wisconsin, USA, cheese is pretty much everywhere - and after learning a little more about the size and impact of the dairy industry and that cheese emits more greenhouse gases than chicken per kilogram, I decided to fix it. By eating a bunch of vegan cheese. That's enough, right?

This is the first in a short series of videos in which I start to explore the balance between personal action and systemic change. This is a topic I've been thinking a lot about - why do I bother when the scope of the climate problem is so much bigger than me?

More serious video next week :) Gotta keep some silliness about.
