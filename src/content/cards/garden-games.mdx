I'd like to talk about my love of visiting state parks and playing what I'm calling "garden games". These are games that are designed to reward exploration; the core game loop is a cycle of exploration and discovery in a carefully constructed environment. (If there's already another term for these games, please let me know! They're some of my favorites, and I'd love to find a way to search for them more easily.) For now, I'm taking the word "garden" after reading the below part of a review of my favorite game, *Eastshade*.

> "Each painting costs inspiration, which you collect by visiting new areas or completing new tasks...Games being pretty isn’t unusual, but **Eastshade’s design is closer to that of a grand garden**. The buildings feel more like follies than functional houses, the bridges come straight from arcadian paintings, and curated lines of sight are key." [*PCGamer*](https://www.pcgamer.com/eastshade-review/) (emphasis mine)

That review is describing *Eastshade*'s environment design, and indeed in playing the game it seems every frame could be a carefully composed painting, but I think the depiction of *Eastshade* as a "grand garden" extends to the broader scope of its game design as well.

### What's a garden?
A garden is a curated environment designed for the enjoyment of nature. According to the concept's [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden), the defining feature of a garden is its curation; if a space hasn't been controlled and curated by a human, it isn't a garden. To extend the definition to games, I replace nature with the game world.

For gardens, the carefully curated experience centers the environment itself, not another end goal.

### Why "garden"?
I also considered the terms "theme park" (later preferring "[amusement park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park)") and "[pleasure garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_garden)".
