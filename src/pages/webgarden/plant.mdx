      I'm a mid-twenties tinkerer and an aspiring <a href="/library/highlights/books/OL52567052M/" target="_blank">half-asser</a>.
      I love to design systems, goof off at the park, play board
      games and D&D, and make music with my friends. This site's mostly a spot for me to think and <a href="/cards" target="_blank">write</a>
      openly, <a href="/library/highlights/tags/vulnerability/" target="_blank">vulnerably</a>, and often.
