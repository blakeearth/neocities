<Layout title="Library">
    Welcome to my library! Here's a list of books I've read. Select a book or a tag to view the associated highlights!

    While you're here, add me as a friend on <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/blakeearth" target="_blank">the StoryGraph</a>! I love seeing what
    others are reading and thinking about.
    
    I hope you leave here with a few more books to add to your TBR!

    ### Bookshelf
    Books are sorted into the years I most recently added highlights from them.
    <Bookshelf/>

    ### Tags
    <TagCloud/>

    You can also check out a [massive list of all highlights](highlights)
    and start from there. I'm working through a bunch of my older highlights and importing and tagging them. I often link to these highlights from [cards](/cards),
    but there's no backlinking (yet).
