<Layout title="Library">
    Someday, this'll have some more features. For now, it's a way to browse the books I've read and the thoughts from them I wanted to save.

    I'm working through a bunch of my older highlights and tagging them. I'd also like to add links back from the highlights or books to the [cards](/cards)
    that mention them. One more note: some of the highlights are marked for this year, but that's really just when I processed themâ€”I'm working on backdating
    those.

    Select a book or a tag to view the associated highlights! You can also check out a [massive list of all highlights](highlights) and start from there. I hope
    you leave here with a few more books to add to your TBR!

    While you're here, add me as a friend on <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/blakeearth" target="_blank">the StoryGraph</a>! I love seeing what
    others are reading and thinking about.
