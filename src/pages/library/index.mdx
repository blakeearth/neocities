    Select a book or a tag to view the associated highlights! You can also check out a [massive list of all highlights](highlights) and start from there. I hope
    you leave here with a few more books to add to your TBR!

    While you're here, add me as a friend on <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/blakeearth" target="_blank">the StoryGraph</a>! I love seeing what
    others are reading and thinking about.

    I'm working through a bunch of my older highlights and importing and tagging them (books tagged with <Tag emoji="ðŸ“‘" href="library/highlights/tags/favorite">favorite</Tag>
    have been imported but not yet tagged). I'd also like to add links back from the highlights or books to the [cards](/cards) that mention them. 
    
    A few more notes. Some of the highlights are marked for this year, but that's really just when I processed themâ€”I'm working on backdating
    those. Also, I'd like to add recommendations or reviews to each book's page.
