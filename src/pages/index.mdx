<Layout title="Welcome!">
  blake earth ðŸ’› he/him
  
  Hello and welcome!
  
  I'm a tinkerer and an aspiring [half-asser](/library/highlights/books/OL52567052M/).
  I love to design systems, goof off at the park, play board
  games and D&D, and make music with my friends. This site's mostly a spot for me to think and [write](/cards)
  openly, [vulnerably](/library/highlights/tags/vulnerability/), and often. I'm building the
  habit of posting. You'll also find a lot of bookish stuff over in my ever-expanding [library](/library).

  Enjoy your visit!
  
  ### About this site 
  You're currently viewing a [Neocities](https://neocities.org/site/blakeearth/)
  iteration of this site, but it has existed in some form since 2017, when I
  bought this domain to use as part of my email address. Since then, I've used "blakeearth" as my handle
  pretty much everywhere on the internet. I picked ".earth" because it was
  available. I was also planning to study environmental science at university
  (in the end, I got a liberal arts degree with a concentration in computer
  science). I've been making websites as long as I've had access to the
  internet, though - since about 2010 or 2011, probably. I made lots of janky
  websites using a mix of the Webs website builder and HTML, including a [fan
  site and cheats blog for
  Poptropica](https://web.archive.org/web/20130504112845/http://poptropicawca.com/).
  I remember making some trackers for Club Penguin (probably with
  [Widgetbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327071108/http://www.widgetbox.com/)),
  but those seem to be lost to the sands of time. I used to play a bunch of
  those online virtual world games (Club Penguin, Poptropica, Webkinz,
  Wizard101, LEGO Universe, and others). They're a big source of creative
  inspiration to me.
