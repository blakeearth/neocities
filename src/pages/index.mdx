<Layout title="Welcome!">
  Welcome to blake.earth, web traveller! Here you'll (eventually) find a trove of silly personal content,
  gamedev chats, media logs, recipes, and whatever other nonsense I decide to
  post on here.
  
  ### About the webmaster
  blake earth ðŸ’› he/him
  
  I'm a tinkerer and a try-it-all-er. I love to design systems, goof off at the park, play board
  games and D&D, and make music with my friends. I live in a studio with big
  windows and a brick patio. I'm near close friends whom I love. I can walk to
  the grocery store, to the farmer's market, and to two lakes, and I can bus and
  bike pretty much everywhere else I'd need to go (though I still drive too
  much). I feel so lucky to have found a home here.
  
  ### About this site 
  This site has existed in some form since 2017, when I bought this domain to use as
  part of my email address. Since then, I've used "blakeearth" as my handle
  pretty much everywhere on the internet. I picked ".earth" because it was
  available. I was also planning to study environmental science at university
  (in the end, I got a liberal arts degree with a concentration in computer
  science). I've been making websites as long as I've had access to the
  internet, though - since about 2010 or 2011, probably. I made lots of janky
  websites using a mix of the Webs website builder and HTML, including a [fan
  site and cheats blog for
  Poptropica](https://web.archive.org/web/20130504112845/http://poptropicawca.com/).
  I remember making some trackers for Club Penguin (probably with
  [Widgetbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327071108/http://www.widgetbox.com/)),
  but those seem to be lost to the sands of time. I used to play a bunch of
  those online virtual world games (Club Penguin, Poptropica, Webkinz,
  Wizard101, LEGO Universe, and others). They're a big source of creative
  inspiration to me.
